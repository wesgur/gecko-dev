## Diagnosis
Function `CORSHeader` parameter `mCredentialsMode` had a mismatching naming convention used throughout the file. This header is one of the most used headers to resolve cross-origin resource sharing. The content of the bug was to fix this inconsistent naming from `mCredentialsMode` to `aCredentialsMode` within one of the header files. This misuse of naming can confuse developers who will implement using this specific header file or function.

## Solution
Under the folder `dom/fetch`, there is a file called `InternalHeaders.h`. To fix this inconsitency, function parameter `mCredentialsMode` has been changed to `aCredentialsMode` in line 118.

## Testing
Even though this is a trivial fix, the fix has been confirmed with the following testing.

```
#!/bin/bash
$ ./mach lint -l eslint dom/fetch/InternalHeaders.h
$ ./mach build
$ ./mach test dom/fetch
```
